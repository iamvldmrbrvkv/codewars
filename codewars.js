Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"

/* Singleton Pattern

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Create an Singleton pattern, so there is one object in system.

Example:

var obj1 = new Singleton();
var obj2 = new Singleton();
obj1 === obj2; // => true
obj1.test = 1;
obj2.test; // => 1 */

var Singleton = function(){

/* Remove First and Last Character Part Two

This is a spin off of my first kata.

You are given a string containing a sequence of character sequences separated by commas.

Write a function which returns a new string containing the same character sequences except the first and the last ones but this time separated by spaces.

If the input string is empty or the removal of the first and last items would cause the resulting string to be empty, return an empty value (represented as a generic value NULL in the examples below).

Examples
"1,2,3"      =>  "2"
"1,2,3,4"    =>  "2 3"
"1,2,3,4,5"  =>  "2 3 4"

""     =>  NULL
"1"    =>  NULL
"1,2"  =>  NULL */

/* Prefill an Array

Create the function prefill that returns an array of n elements that all have the same value v. See if you can do this without using a loop.

You have to validate input:

v can be anything (primitive or otherwise)
if v is ommited, fill the array with undefined
if n is 0, return an empty array
if n is anything other than an integer or integer-formatted string (e.g. '123') that is >=0, throw a TypeError
When throwing a TypeError, the message should be n is invalid, where you replace n for the actual value passed to the function.

Code Examples

    prefill(3,1) --> [1,1,1]
    
    prefill(2,"abc") --> ['abc','abc']
    
    prefill("1", 1) --> [1]
    
    prefill(3, prefill(2,'2d'))
      --> [['2d','2d'],['2d','2d'],['2d','2d']]
      
    prefill("xyz", 1)
      --> throws TypeError with message "xyz is invalid" */

setSecret() which sets the secret

/* Using closures to share class state

In object-oriented programming, it is sometimes useful to have private shared state among all instances of a class; in other languages, like ruby, this shared state would be tracked with a class variable. In javascript we achieve this through closures and immediately-invoked function expressions.

In this kata, I want you to write make a Cat constructor that takes arguments name and weight to instantiate a new cat object. The constructor should also have an averageWeight method that returns the average weight of cats created with the constructor.

garfield = new Cat('garfield', 25);
Cat.averageWeight(); // 25

felix = new Cat('felix', 15);
Cat.averageWeight();   // now 20
But that's not all. Cats can change weight. Use Object.defineProperty to write custom setters and getters for the weight property so that the following works properly even as instances change their weight value:

felix.weight = 25;
felix.weight // 25
Cat.averageWeight(); // now 25
Object.defineProperty must be used to pass all tests. Storing a reference to all instances and recalculating the average weight each time is easier, but would prevent garbage collection from working properly if used in a production environment.

Finally, since average weight is an aggregate statistic it's important that we validate constructor arguments so that no cats are created without a specified weight; so, make sure to throw an error if both arguments are not recieved by the constructor.

Summary of requirements:
Cat constructor, requiring arguments for name and weight
Throw an error if name or weight not specified when invoking the constructor.
Cat.averageWeight() method should give the average weight of all cat instances created with Cat, even after if the instance's properties have changed.
Must use Object.defineProperty */

// Let's make a Cat constructor!
var Cat = (function () {
  var cats = {
    count: 0,
    totalWeight: 0,
    avgWeight: 0
  }
  
  function Cat (name, weight) {
    if (!name || !weight) {
      throw new Error('Both `name` and `weight` should be provided');
    }
    cats.count++;
    this.name = name;

    Object.defineProperty(this, 'weight', {
      get: function () {
        return this._weight || 0;
      },
      set: function (val) {
        cats.totalWeight = cats.totalWeight - this.weight + val;
        cats.avgWeight =  cats.totalWeight / cats.count;
        return this._weight = val;
      }
    });

    this.weight = weight;
  }
  
  Cat.averageWeight = function () {
    return cats.avgWeight;
  }
  
  return Cat;
  
}());

/*  Chain adding function

We want to create a function that will add numbers together when called in succession.

add(1)(2); // == 3
We also want to be able to continue to add numbers to our chain.

add(1)(2)(3); // == 6
add(1)(2)(3)(4); //  == 10
add(1)(2)(3)(4)(5); // == 15
and so on.

A single call should be equal to the number passed in.

add(1); // == 1
We should be able to store the returned values and reuse them.

var addTwo = add(2);
addTwo; // == 2
addTwo + 5; // == 7
addTwo(3); // == 5
addTwo(3)(5); // == 10
We can assume any number being passed in will be valid whole number. */

function add(n){
  var fn = function(x) {
    return add(n + x);
  };
  
  fn.valueOf = function() {
    return n;
  };
  
  return fn;
}

// Function Cache

// If you are calculating complex things or execute time-consuming API calls, you sometimes want to cache the results. In this case we want you to create a function wrapper, which takes a function and caches its results depending on the arguments, that were applied to the function.

// Usage example:

// var complexFunction = function(arg1, arg2) { /* complex calculation in here */ };
// var cachedFunction = cache(complexFunction);

// cachedFunction('foo', 'bar'); // complex function should be executed
// cachedFunction('foo', 'bar'); // complex function should not be invoked again, instead the cached result should be returned
// cachedFunction('foo', 'baz'); // should be executed, because the method wasn't invoked before with these arguments

const cache = require('lodash/memoize')

/* Counting Duplicate

Count the number of Duplicates
Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

Example
"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
"aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice */

function duplicateCount(text){
  return (text.toLowerCase().split('').sort().join('').match(/([^])\1+/g) || []).length
}

/* Function composition

Javascript functions can be combined to form new functions. For example the functions addOne and multTwo can be combined to form a new function which first adds one and then multiplies by two, as follows:

const addOne = (a) => a + 1
const multTwo = (b) => b * 2
const addOneMultTwo = (c) => multTwo(addOne(c))

addOneMultTwo(5) // returns 12
Combining functions like this is called function composition. Functional programming libraries in Javascript such as Ramda include a generic compose function which does the heavy lifting of combining functions for you. So you could implement addOneMultTwo as follows:

const addOneMultTwo = compose(multTwo, addOne)

addOneMultTwo(5) // returns 12
A simple implementation of compose, could work as follows:

const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a))
The arguments f and g are unary functions (i.e. functions which take one argument). The problem with this compose function is that it only composes two functions. Your task is to write a compose function which can compose any number of functions together. */

const compose = (...fns) => arg => fns.reduceRight((res, fn) => fn(res), arg)

/* "Stringing"+"Me"+"Along"

Implement a function that receives a string, and lets you extend it with repeated calls. When no argument is passed you should return a string consisting of space-separated words you've received earlier.

Note: There will always be at least 1 string; all inputs will be non-empty.

For example:

createMessage("Hello")("World!")("how")("are")("you?")() === "Hello World! how are you?"
Tip (helpful, but not necessary): Try using classes!

Good luck and happy coding! */

function createMessage(prev) {
  return (next) => next ? createMessage(`${prev} ${next}`) : prev
}

/* I Spy

NOTE: The test cases for this kata are broken, but for some reason CodeWars has locked them and I cannot edit them. Specifically, the returned function is not propertly testing that old values are remembered. If and when I can fix the problem, I will, but I don't see any way to do that due to the lock.

In testing, a spy function is one that keeps track of various metadata regarding its invocations. Some examples of properties that a spy might track include:

Whether it was invoked
How many times it was invoked
What arguments it was called with
What contexts it was called in
What values it returned
Whether it threw an error
For this kata, implement a spyOn function which takes any function func as a parameter and returns a spy for func. The returned spy must be callable in the same manner as the original func, and include the following additional properties/methods:

.callCount() â€” returns the number of times spy has been called
.wasCalledWith(val) â€“ returns true if spy was ever called with val, else returns false.
.returned(val) â€” returns true if spy ever returned val, else returns false
Below is a specific example of how spyOn might work in the wild.

function adder(n1, n2) { return n1 + n2; }
var adderSpy = spyOn( adder );

adderSpy(2, 4); // returns 6
adderSpy(3, 5); // returns 8
adderSpy.callCount(); // returns 2
adderSpy.wasCalledWith(4); // true
adderSpy.wasCalledWith(0); // false
adderSpy.returned(8); // true
adderSpy.returned(0); // false */

function spyOn(func) {
  let calls = 0
  let all = []
  let val
  
  const spy = function(...args) {
    calls++
    all.push(...args)
    val = func.apply(this, args)
    return val
  }
  
  spy.callCount = () => calls
  spy.wasCalledWith = (x) => all.some((a) => x === a)
  spy.returned = (x) => x === val
  
  return spy
}

/* SantaClausable Interface

You probably know, that in Javascript (and also Ruby) there is no concept of interfaces. There is only a concept of inheritance, but you can't assume that a certain method or property exists, just because it exists in the parent prototype / class. We want to find out, whether a given object fulfils the requirements to implement the "SantaClausable" interface. We need to implement a method which checks for this interface.

Rules
The SantaClausable interface is implemented, if all of the following methods are defined on an object:

sayHoHoHo() / say_ho_ho_ho
distributeGifts() / distribute_gifts
goDownTheChimney() / go_down_the_chimney
Example
var santa = {
    sayHoHoHo: function() { console.log('Ho Ho Ho!') },
    distributeGifts: function() { console.log('Gifts for all!'); },
    goDownTheChimney: function() { console.log('*whoosh*'); }
};

var notSanta = {
    sayHoHoHo: function() { console.log('Oink Oink!') }
    // no distributeGifts() and no goDownTheChimney()
};

isSantaClausable(santa); // must return TRUE
isSantaClausable(notSanta); // must return FALSE

  return ['sayHoHoHo', 'distributeGifts', 'goDownTheChimney'].every(function(methodName) {
    return typeof obj[methodName] === 'function'
  })

/* new with apply

In JavaScript we can create objects using the new operator.

For example, if you have this constructor function:

function Greeting(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Greeting.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  return "Hello " + this.name;
};


Greeting.prototype.sayBye = function() {
  return "Bye " + this.name;
};
You can create a Greeting object in this way:

  var greeting = new Greeting('John');
new operator is evil because it produces a highly coupled code, difficult to maintain and test.

Some patterns to reduce coupling are object factories or dependency injection.

These patterns can benefit of the construct() function.

This function receives a constructor function and possibly some arguments and it returns a new object constructed with the function and the passed arguments.

This is another way to create the greeting object:

var greeting = construct(Greeting, 'John');
And a factory could use like this:

  function factory() {
    return {
      createGreeting() {
        return construct(Greeting, arguments);
      }
      ...
    }
  }
Your work is to implement the construct() function. */

function construct(Class, ...arg) {
  return new Class(...arg)
}

/* Extract Nested Object Reference

You are given a complex object that has many deeply nested variables. You don't want to go the usual if obj.property == null route. Create a prototype method that given a nested path, either return the value or undefined.

    name: 'joe',
    history: {
      hometown: 'bratislava',
      bio: {
        funFact: 'I like fishing.'

obj.hash('person.history.bio'); // { funFact: 'I like fishing.' }
obj.hash('person.history.homeStreet'); // undefined
obj.hash('person.animal.pet.needNoseAntEater'); // undefined */

// return the nested property value if it exists,
// otherwise return undefined
Object.prototype.hash = function(string) {
  let obj = this
  string.split('.').forEach(function(el) {

/* Array Helpers

This kata is designed to test your ability to extend the functionality of built-in classes. In this case, we want you to extend the built-in Array class with the following methods: square(), cube(), average(), sum(), even() and odd().

Explanation:

square() must return a copy of the array, containing all values squared
cube() must return a copy of the array, containing all values cubed
average() must return the average of all array values; on an empty array must return NaN (note: the empty array is not tested in Ruby!)
sum() must return the sum of all array values
even() must return an array of all even numbers
odd() must return an array of all odd numbers
Note: the original array must not be changed in any case!

Example
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.square();  // must return [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
numbers.cube();    // must return [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
numbers.average(); // must return 3
numbers.sum();     // must return 15
numbers.even();    // must return [2, 4]
numbers.odd();     // must return [1, 3, 5] */

Array.prototype.square = function() {
  return this.map(a => Math.pow(a, 2))
}

Array.prototype.cube = function() {

}

Array.prototype.sum = function() {
  return this.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
}

Array.prototype.average = function() {
  return this.sum() / this.length
}

Array.prototype.even = function() {
  return this.filter(a => !(a % 2))
}

Array.prototype.odd = function() {
  return this.filter(a => !!(a % 2))
}
